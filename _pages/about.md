<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Associate Professor (Research Fellow)„ÄÅDoctoral Supervisor (ÂçöÂØº) in School of Integrated Circuits (ÈõÜÊàêÁîµË∑ØÂ≠¶Èô¢), Nanjing University. In 2018, I joined the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University.

I received the B.S. degree in microelectronics and solid state electronics and the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.

My research interest includes AI for chip architecture design automation, NoC-based multi-core architectures, high energy efficiency AI chip design, reconfigurable computing, and 3D IC design. My papers are published in prestigious international journals (such as IEEE TC/TCAD/TCAS-I/TVLSI/TCAS-II/IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL) and proceedings (such as ASP-DAC, ICCD, CASES, ISCAS, BioCas). I have been authorized 55 patents.
